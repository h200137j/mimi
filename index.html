            Maybe I'm being petty. I kinda feel I am. Maybe I'm over reacting.
            But I'm angry with myself, I'm angry at the world. I hate how I have
            fallen for you, yet I have loved every moment of it.
            <span class="emphasis">Euphoria</span>. A dream I do not want to
            end.
          </p>

          <p>
            In my head we grow old together, have 2 kids, they are all grown
            now, so it's just you and I in a big house. It's funny but there are
            some rooms we haven't been in for a while now.
          </p>

          <p>
            I don't blame you for not wanting me the way I want you. I tend to
            go a bit extra when I have fallen in love. Go over board. Make grand
            gestures etcetera etcetera. But I'm all grown now. I recognize the
            difference in our emotions, lest I fall upon a sword and do
            something I will regret, I need to step back.
          </p>

          <p>
            Perhaps you are right, maybe there is a future where I say hie one
            day and we go on like nothing ever happened. That would be nice.
          </p>

          <p>
            I love you, I want to spend my every moment with you. Close. To have
            the honor of being loved by you. To stand before all in heaven and
            in earth as they stand witnesses to the love we blossom. Maybe it's
            a fantasy. I think I moved too fast. That's on me. Something I need
            to work on. But I love you now and always. There is an immutable
            space in my heart for you, for as long as the earth remains.
          </p>

          <p>
            I will miss you, I think of you everyday. Replaying memories,
            holding your hand while I drive. Your hugs, your fragrance. The way
            my tummy did things at the sight of you. My lunavere. I will miss
            you more than you can fathom. And I will love you always.
          </p>

          <p class="final-line">Know you are loved.</p>
